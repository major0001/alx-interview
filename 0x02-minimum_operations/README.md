Minimum Operations Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on calculating the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly `n` characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The task requires an understanding of several algorithmic and mathematical concepts, such as dynamic programming, prime factorization, greedy algorithms, and basic Python programming.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming can help break down the problem into smaller subproblems and build up the solution incrementally. It is a key approach to efficiently solving this problem.

- **Resource:** [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

### 2. Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is crucial for understanding the problem, as the minimum number of operations can be derived from the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

- **Resource:** [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:exponents/x2f8bb11595b61c86:prime-factorization/v/prime-factorization)

### 3. Code Optimization
Optimizing code to run efficiently is important, especially when dealing with large values of `n`.

- **Resource:** [How to optimize Python code](https://realpython.com/python-optimization/)

### 4. Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms involve making the most optimal choice at each step, which can be a useful strategy in solving this problem.

- **Resource:** [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

### 5. Basic Python Programming
Proficiency in Python is necessary to implement the solution, including knowledge of loops, conditionals, and functions.

- **Resource:** [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

## Requirements

- **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version:** Python 3.4.3
- **Style Guidelines:** PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
- **File Requirements:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of each file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - All code should be documented.
  - All files must be executable.

## Task

### 0. Minimum Operations
Write a function `minOperations(n)` that calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters in a text file.

- **Prototype:** `def minOperations(n)`
- **Returns:** An integer representing the minimum number of operations.
- **If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`.**

#### Example:
For `n = 9`, the sequence of operations would be:
```
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
Number of operations: 6
```

### How to Run
To test the function, create a Python script with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

Run the script using the command:

```bash
./0-main.py
```
